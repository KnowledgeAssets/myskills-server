A lightweight web application to capture, manage and analyze skills of users and help them improve their capabilities by connecting them with each other and assisting with personalized suggestions for coaches, trainings, projects and many more.

== INCUBATION WARNING

*This project is in the incubation stage and is by far NOT ready for production use!*

== Getting started

=== Introduction

MySkills Server is a Java web application implementing the backend of the MySkills ecosystem. This server has no graphical user interface. It exposes a REST API to allow clients (e.g. the _MySkills WebApp_) to interact with the various MySkills functionalities via network. The server takes care of persistently storing the data of the MySkills domain model in a separate database.

=== System requirements

For running the application using the executable JAR file:

* Java Runtime Environment 11
* Neo4j Community Edition 3.4.x

For running the application as a Docker container:

* Docker 18.06 (or higher)
* _Optional:_ Docker Compose

For development:

* Java Development Kit 11
* Neo4j Community Edition 3.4.x
* _Optional:_ Docker 18.06 (or higher), useful for setting up a Neo4j database

=== Building the application from source

The project uses https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] as the build tool. Run the following command in the project root to build the application:

    mvnw package

The final executable JAR file is produced in the `target` subdirectory.

=== Running the executable JAR file

After completing the Maven build you can run the MySkills Server like a simple Java application:

    java -jar target/myskills-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Configuration properties to customize the URIs of database and authorization server can be passed as command line arguments:

----
java -jar target/myskills-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  --spring.data.neo4j.uri=bolt://192.168.99.100:7687 \
  --security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=http://192.168.99.100:9000/auth/realms/MySkills
----

=== Running as Docker container

We do not offer public Docker images at the moment but you can create your own after completing the Maven build. Run the following command in the project root (mind the dot at the end):

----
docker build \
  -t myskills/server:latest \
  --build-arg JAR_FILE=target/myskills-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  .
----

Then you can start the container as usual:

----
docker run \
  --name myskills \
  --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  myskills/server:latest
----

=== Testing the setup

Once the application has started the API documentation should be available at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

=== Technology overview

As described in the introduction the MySkills Server is a pure server application with no graphical user interface. The project makes use of the following noteworthy frameworks:

* https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot]: Provides the basis for the Java web application. Within the application itself it faciliates the configuration of the Spring application context. Furthermore, we use the Spring Boot Maven plugin to build the executable JAR file including an embedded Tomcat server.
* https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework[Spring Web MVC]: The REST API provided by the application is implemented using Spring Web MVC controllers. We use that synchronous variant instead of WebFlux at the moment.
* https://spring.io/projects/spring-security[Spring Security]: Provides the authentication and authorization, including method security to implement access control for the REST endpoints.
* https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j]: We use this graph database to store the current state of the domain model and to obtain insights in the network of relationships between users, skills and more domain objects. The Neo4j database is typically connected to the application by the Bolt driver which is auto-configured by Spring Boot. For test automation there is also the embedded driver in the project setup.
* https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j/[Spring Data Neo4j]: The graph database is accessed via Spring Data repositories and Spring Transaction handles the transaction management. Most of this data access layer is also auto-configured by Spring Boot.
* http://springfox.github.io/springfox/[Springfox]: Provides the auto-generated Swagger UI with the REST API documentation.
* https://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit 5] and Spring Test support are used to implement automated tests for different slices of the application. Neo4j repository tests are supported by an embedded Neo4j database.

=== Setting up the Neo4j database

MySkills Server requires a https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] database for persistent storage.

Option 1: You can download the database server https://neo4j.com/download-center/#releases[directly from the website] and install it on your system.

Option 2: You can start Neo4j as a Docker container.

* On Windows:
+
----
docker run ^
  --name neo4j ^
  -d ^
  -p 7474:7474 ^
  -p 7687:7687 ^
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=none ^
  neo4j:3.4
----

* On Unix/Mac:
+
----
docker run \
  --name neo4j \
  -d \
  -p 7474:7474 \
  -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=none \
  neo4j:3.4
----

This will create a container named `neo4j` which you start/stop simply like this:

----
docker start neo4j
docker stop neo4j
----

Visit http://localhost:7474/ to view the Neo4j browser.

_Note: The `dev` profile of the MySkills Server assumes that the `bolt` endpoint of Neo4j is available at `localhost:7687`. The database server must be accessible when starting the MySkills Server._

=== Configuring annotation processors

The source code makes use of https://projectlombok.org/[Lombok] annotations to generate getters, setters, etc. in POJO classes. The build process takes care of processing these annotations at compile time but any IDE may require further configuration to make internal builds work.

For IntelliJ IDEA:

* Install the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok-plugin[Lombok Plugin]
* Open the project settings, navigate to `Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors` and activate the checkbox `Enable annotation processing`.

For Visual Studio Code:

Install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GabrielBB.vscode-lombok[Lombok Annotations Support] before opening the project workspace.

=== Running the application from the IDE

You can run the application by using the Java class `io.knowledgeassets.myskills.server.MySkillsServerApplication` as main class in a usual Java launch configuration.

For IntelliJ IDEA right-click on this class and select `Run 'MySkillsServer....main()'` from the context menu.

For Visual Studio Code a launch configuration is already included in the repository.

_Note: You should enable the Spring profile `dev` to activate some configuration properties suitable for a development environment. A general way to do this is to add the command line argument `--spring.profiles.active=dev` to the launch configuration._

=== Configuring test users

MySkills Server requires an external OpenID Connect provider to generate ID token which can be used to authorize API requests.

During development a local https://www.keycloak.org/[KeyCloak] server is recommended to manage test users and create access token.

Option 1: You can download KeyCloak https://www.keycloak.org/downloads.html[directly from the website] and install it on your system.

Option 2: You can start KeyCloak as a Docker container.

* On Windows:
+
----
docker run ^
  --name keycloak ^
  -d ^
  -p 9000:8080 ^
  -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin ^
  -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin ^
  jboss/keycloak:4.5.0.Final
----
* On Unix/Mac:
+
----
docker run \
  --name keycloak \
  -d \
  -p 9000:8080 \
  -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin \
  -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin \
  jboss/keycloak:4.5.0.Final
----

This will create a container named `keycloak` which you start/stop simply like this:

----
docker start keycloak
docker stop keycloak
----

Visit http://localhost:9000/auth/ to configure the KeyCloak server.

There is an export of a suitable test realm in `tools/keycloak/myskills-realm.json` which can be imported into the KeyCloak server. Simply log in to the administration console, select "Add realm" and upload the JSON file.

The test realm comes with a preconfigured client for MySkills but contains no test users. *You have to create users manually within the `MySkills` realm.*

_Note: The `dev` profile of the MySkills Server assumes that the KeyCloak server is available at `localhost:9000` and contains a realm named `MySkills`. The KeyCloak server must be accessible when starting the MySkills Server._

=== Testing the application

In order to execute the automated tests run the following command in the project root:

    mvnw test

Project test coverage is reported by https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html[JaCoCo Maven plugin].

To generate JaCoCo test coverage report it is necessary to run `prepare-package` maven build phase.

    mvnw prepare-package

After the phase has been completed JaCoCo test coverage report can be found in `target/site/jacoco/index.html`.

Travis CI uploads JaCoCo test coverage reports to https://codecov.io[codecov.io]. Uploaded reports can be found https://codecov.io/gh/KnowledgeAssets/myskills-server[here].

=== Exploring the API

Open the Swagger UI of the running application: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

=== Architecture overview

Fundamentally, the MySkills Server is based on the conventions of the https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] framework. If you are familiar with that framework you should have an easy start with the project.

==== Source code structure

The base package `io.knowledgeassets.myskills.server` contains several sub-packages with focus on specific parts of the domain model. For example, `io.knowledgeassets.myskills.server.skill` contains everything related to skills as a domain object, including entity classes, data repositories, service implementations and controllers for the corresponding REST API.

_A basic design principle of MySkills Server is the application of the CQRS pattern (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)._

In short words, all read access to the domain model is strictly separated from the write access. This segregation is made explicit by the separate `command` and `query` packages inside each domain package. For example:

* `io.knowledgeassets.myskills.server.skill.command`: Contains all the code dedicated to modifications of skills
** Service implementation with methods representing the commands which alter the state of the domain model
** Controller implementation which provides POST, PUT and DELETE operations to modify the domain model
* `io.knowledgeassets.myskills.server.skill.query`: Contains all the code dedicated to reading skills
** Service implementation with methods to lookup domain objects and compile different views on the domain model
** Controller implementation which provides GET operations to request views on the domain model

_Important rule: Code from the `command` package may use code from the `query` package, e.g. to perform validation. But under no circumstances is the code in the `query` package allowed to use code from the `command` package!_

==== Authentication and authorization

The https://spring.io/projects/spring-security[Spring Security] framework is used to implement user authentication and access control for the provided API resources.

The application is implemented as a stateless OAuth2 resource server. Each API request must be authorized by including an `Authorization` header with a valid ID token:

    Authorization: Bearer <ID token>

The signature of the ID token is validated using the public key of the authorization server (offline validation). By default, this public key is automatically loaded on startup from the JWK set URI of the authorization server.
